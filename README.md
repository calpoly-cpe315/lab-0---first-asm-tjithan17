  * Partially complete
  * Code does not properly print haiku

These README files have a fairly rich _Markdown_ environment. You should use
markdown syntax to format your README files in such a way that they look
professional, and are easy to read. Use the 
[Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and
have fun! :octocat:
